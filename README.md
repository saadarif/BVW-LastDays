# Scrollytelling experience for the Last Days of the Black-veined White in Britain

## Content

The content for this web app draws from this publication and sources therein:

> The last days of Aporia crataegi (L.) in Britain: evaluating genomic erosion in an extirpated butterfly
> Rebecca Whitla, Korneel Hens, James Hogan, Geoff Martin, Casper Breuker, Timothy G. Shreeve, Saad Arif (2024) *Molecular Ecology*, e17518
> ; doi: https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.17518

## Tools and Development

A component-based rich media / scrollytelling template made with Svelte using the the [ONS Scrolltelling components and libraries](https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2021/06/02/how-we-build-scrollytelling-articles/). 
if you want to build your own scrollytelling page, I suggest you start from ONS's original template.
